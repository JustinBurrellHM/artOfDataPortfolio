# Discussion: Meta-Analysis of Research!

#### Analyze and question the data that the scientists use.
The [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191121183923.htm) I found was about sleep. I barely get sleep. I wondered how sleep deprivation effects ones performance. After searching the web, I found a study conducted by Michigan State University. MSU's Sleep and Learning lab wanted to show people the negative effects sleep deprivation has on the mind. In one study, The researchers recruited 138 people; 77 to stay awake all night and 61 go to sleep. The two participants then took two separate cognitive tasks in the evening; one that measured reaction time to a stimulus, and the other measured a participant's ability to maintain their place in a series of steps without repeating a step. The participants then repeated the two tasks in the morning. I wonder where the experiment took place. Does the place where the participants slept affect the results? For example, I would have a higher quality sleep in my room than a lab. Also, was the sleep schedule of the particiapnts taken in to consideration? Even if an individual does not sleep for 24 hours, if they get 8-10 hours of sleep nightly they could possibly get through the day. On the other hand, even if a participant went to sleep, if they normally get 2-5 hours of sleep nightly, they could still be sluggish.

#### Analyze their results. Do you trust their findings? Why or why not?

#### What is being done about these issues?

#### How might "publish or perish" have affected this study?
