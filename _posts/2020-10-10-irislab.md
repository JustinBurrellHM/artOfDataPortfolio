# The Iris Lab!

#### Which species of iris has the longest petals (on average)?
After finding the average length of petals for each Iris type, it was found that Iris-virginica had the longest petals on average. The average length of petals of Iris-virginica were 5.54 units. Secondly, the average length of petals of Iris-versicolor were 4.25 units. Finally, the average length of petals of Iris-setosa were 1.47 units.

#### Which species of iris has the widest sepals (on average)?
After finding the average width of sepals for each Iris type, it was found that Iris-setosa had the widest sepals on average. The average width of sepals of Iris-setosa were 3.42 units. Secondly, the average width of sepals of Iris-virginica were 2.97 units. Finally, the average width of sepals of Iris-versicolor were 2.76 units. 

#### Describe your process in finding these answers. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didnâ€™t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. 

##### Step One: The Setup 
1. I first imported csv into my file. This was so I could use csv commands in order to read iris.csv files.
2. Then, I created dictionaries lengthAverage and widthAverage. These dictionaries were set up in the beginning in order to create new dictionaries to hold keys and values from iris.csv that I want to determine the longest petal and widest sepal on average.

##### Step Two: Modifying lengthAverage
1. `with open("iris.csv", "r") as f:` is used to first analyze iris.csv. 
2. `data = csv.DictReader(f)` is used to establish the variable data as csv.DictReader(f). f stands for all of iris.csv, and csv.DictReader is used to read iris.csv as a dictionary; where the data has keys and values for each label. (species, petal-length, etc.)
3. What lines 14-20 mean:
    -`for row in data:` establishes the new variable row to represent data.
    -`if not row["species"] in lengthAverage: lengthAverage[row["species"]] = []` means that if row["species"] if not a key in lengthAverage, make row["species"] a key in lengthAverage, and give the new key a blank list as its value. For example, if row["Iris-setosa"] is not a key in lengthAverage, create that key, and give that key a blank list.
    -`else: lengthAverage[row["species"]].append(float(row["petal-length"]))` means that now, if row["species"] is a key in lengthAverage, we will update the blank list value with the values of petal-length in that species on iris.csv. In this example, all the petal-length values under Iris-setosa in iris.csv are now in the list which is a value of Iris-setosa in lengthAverage.

##### Step Three: Modyifying widthAverage
1. `with open("iris.csv", "r") as f:` is used to first analyze iris.csv. 
2. `data = csv.DictReader(f)` is used to establish the variable data as csv.DictReader(f). f stands for all of iris.csv, and csv.DictReader is used to read iris.csv as a dictionary; where the data has keys and values for each label. (species, petal-length, etc.)
3. What lines 26-32 mean:
    -`for row in data:` establishes the new variable row to represent data.
    -`if not row["species"] in widthAverage: widthAverage[row["species"]] = []` means that if row["species"] if not a key in widthAverage, make row["species"] a key in widthAverage, and give the new key a blank list as its value. For example, if row["Iris-virginica"] is not a key in widthAverage, create that key, and give that key a blank list.
    -`else: widthAverage[row["species"]].append(float(row["sepal-width"]))` means that now, if row["species"] is a key in widthAverage, we will update the blank list value with the values of sepal-width in that species on iris.csv. In this example, all the sepal-width values under Iris-virginica in iris.csv are now in the list which is a value of Iris-virginica in widthAverage.

##### Step Four: Creating an Average Function
1. The function Average has a parameter of a list, and once given that list, returns the sum of the list divided by the length of the list. This is how the average of a list can be found.

##### Step Five: Applying Average Function to lengthAverage and widthAverage
1. After modifying lengthAverage, widthAverage, and creating an Average function, we can use the Average function in order to find the average of the lists we created in our two dictionaries.
2. What lines 39-41 mean:
    -`print(Average(lengthAverage[('Iris-setosa')]))` means that the function Average() is being called, and the parameter is lengthAverage[('Iris-setosa')]. This means that the Average function is looking in the dictionary lengthAverage, in the key Iris-setosa, and looking at the list value to find the average which was 1.47 units. Because lengthAverage is the dictionary of petal-length, this is the average of petal lengths.
    -`print(Average(lengthAverage[('Iris-versicolor')]))` means that the function Average() is being called, and the parameter is lengthAverage[('Iris-versicolor')]. This means that the Average function is looking in the dictionary lengthAverage, in the key Iris-versicolor, and looking at the list value to find the average which was 4.25 units. Because lengthAverage is the dictionary of petal-length, this is the average of petal lengths.
    -`print(Average(lengthAverage[('Iris-virginica')]))` means that the function Average() is being called, and the parameter is lengthAverage[('Iris-virginica')]. This means that the Average function is looking in the dictionary lengthAverage, in the key Iris-virginica, and looking at the list value to find the average which was 5.54 units. Because lengthAverage is the dictionary of petal-length, this is the average of petal lengths.
3. What lines 44-46 mean:
    -`print(Average(widthAverage[('Iris-setosa')]))` means that the function Average() is being called, and the parameter is widthAverage[('Iris-setosa')]. This means that the Average function is looking in the dictionary widthAverage, in the key Iris-setosa, and looking at the list value to find the average which was 3.42 units. Because widthAverage is the dictionary of sepal-width, this is the average of sepal widths.
    -`print(Average(widthAverage[('Iris-versicolor')]))` means that the function Average() is being called, and the parameter is widthAverage[('Iris-versicolor')]. This means that the Average function is looking in the dictionary widthAverage, in the key Iris-versicolor, and looking at the list value to find the average which was 2.76 units. Because widthAverage is the dictionary of sepal-width, this is the average of sepal widths.
    -`print(Average(widthAverage[('Iris-virginica')]))` means that the function Average() is being called, and the parameter is widthAverage[('Iris-virginica')]. This means that the Average function is looking in the dictionary widthAverage, in the key Iris-virginica, and looking at the list value to find the average which was 2.97 units. Because widthAverage is the dictionary of sepal-width, this is the average of sepal widths.

##### My Struggles 
Steps One to Four was simple. That was similar to our previous homework assignment. However, what I struggled with was how to properally call the list values for each key in my dictionaries. For example, in line 39 `print(Average(lengthAverage[('Iris-setosa')]))`, I struggled to figure out how to call that list. I first used `print(Average(lengthAverage[('species')]))` because I thought that would give me the averages of all three species at the same time. However, I was given the error "unhashable type: 'list.' In confusion, I had gone to the internet for help. I had found an article by [CareerKarma](https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-typeerror-unhashable-type-list/), However it said that that error occurs when you attempt to use a list as a key value. I knew this would not help me because looking at lines 14-20 and lines 26-32, I had added row["species"] to lengthAverage with a list as its value. After discussing my problem with my friend Chandler Reyes, I had realized my mistake. I had learned that row["species"] is a **placeholder**, not the actual syntax for the keys in my dictionary. If I want to refer to the actual keys made in the dictionary, I would have to use the species names given in iris.csv. Then, I had come to the my second iteration, `print(Average(lengthAverage[['Iris-setosa']]))`. This did not work. I was confused, and after thinking through my error on my own, I had realized that 'Iris-setosa' should not be wrapped in [], but in (). I had originally thought that it should be wrapped in [] beacuse it was related to a dictionary, but after running `print(lengthAverage)` to see the syntax of the dictionary, I had learned that when referring to keys in a dictionary, you must use (). [] Are only used **to refer to the dictionary itself**, which in this case was lengthAverage which was not what I wanted. I finally came to the conclusion that `print(Average(lengthAverage[('Iris-setosa')]))` was the proper syntax. Once this had worked, I could use this format to find the average of all the list values in all the keys of both lengthAverage and widthAverage.

Besides that, I had an understanding of how I found my answers to the original questions; Which species of iris has the longest petals (on average), and Which species of iris has the widest sepals (on average)?

##### What I Learned 
1. How to read csv files
2. How to create dictionaries from given data and how my created dictionaries can have keys and values from any part of the given csv file.
3. How to create functions to help analyze csv files.
4. What the exact parameters are for keys and values in dictionaries created from csv files.
