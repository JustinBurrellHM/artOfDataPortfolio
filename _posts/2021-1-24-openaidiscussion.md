# Discussion: OpenAI!

#### 1. What are some of the ambiguities regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI)?
There are. OpenAI is unsure of what exactly their goal is. They claim to want to create a machine with the learning and reasoning power of a human mind, but what exactly is that?

#### 2. What was OpenAIâ€™s initial mission and philosophy?
OpenAI wants to provide AGI to everyone. They want AGI to be accessible to all, and OpenAI also shares their code for others to use and innovate. I think that is really cool, since most AI corporations are wealthy for profit companies.
	
#### 3. What strategy does OpenAI seem to be adopting for achieving AGI?
OpenAI wants to be "open." They want to work with companies if they make a breakthrough. This is still kinda sus, becasue if OpenAI really does have open-source code, what stop another person or company from using that code, adding to it, and then taking all the credit for it?

#### 4. Elaborate on a few of the current criticisms of OpenAI.
OpenAI actually is not achieving their mission. A great example of this is GPT-2. OpenAI claims that this AI, which is able to create an article from a few words, was "too dangerous" to release since it could be used to spread masswide disinformation. A valid question about this would be "Why should we able to trust OpenAI?" A think OpenAI's lack of transparency has potential to create a society that is ruled by AI and the people who control that AI.

#### 5. What do you personally think AGI should be capable of? In other words, what do you imagine successfully-achieved AGI to be?
I think that AGI, at its best, should be a tool used by humans. It scares me that people want to create AGI that replaces human. At the end of the day, what differentiates humans from computer is computer and intution. Computer cannot just think about things based off of experiences and common sense. Not even quantum computer have common sense. AGI should be something humans use to make life easier. I fear that companies like OpenAI, which a goal to profit off of AGI, will end up governing the world since AGI has replaced most human jobs.
