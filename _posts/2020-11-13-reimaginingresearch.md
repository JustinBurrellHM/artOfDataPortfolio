#  Reimagining Research!
The [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235285322030122X#ab010) is titled "Depression, anxiety, and stress mediate the associations between internet gaming disorder, insomnia, and quality of life during the COVID-19 outbreak." 

#### 1. Identify a statistical question that you could ask.
A statistical questions I could ask is how does extensive hours of gaming effect the brain, especially how does it effect social interaction and mental health.

#### 2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
The population would be people under the age of 25 who has played videogames for more than three years. This is done because the brain develops until the age of 25, so extensive gaming might have a greater negative impact on young people than it does older developed people. Also, the population would include a mininmum amount of years played, because someone who just started playing videogames will not immediately be impacted by extensive gaming.

#### 3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
My sample frame will include college students from a select group of college from around the US. College students from NYC might not game as much as student from North Dakota, so using a wide range of colleges from around the country will help make the sample frame for inclusive.

#### 4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
The sample methods I would include voluntary and cluster sampling. The study would use cluster sampling, since our sample frame includes seperates groups of colleges, and the study would be voluntary because students from each college have the choice to participate.

#### 5. Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
The null hypotheses is that there is no correlation between extensive gaming, social interaction, and mental health. The alternative hypotheses would be that there is a correlation between extensive gaming, social interaction, and mental health.

#### 6. Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.
Subjects would play for either 20 mins, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours. The treatment would be the amount of hours played since the study is to determine how extensive hours of gaming effects the brain, so we would include a wide range of hours played to show how the brain is effected by different amounts of hours played. 

#### 7. Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.
As stated, the treatment groups would be the amount of hours played. Each subject would be randomly assigned to a group.

#### 8. Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.
All subjects would play Fornite on the Xbox One. They would play in the same room, which includes a gaming chair, food, and drinks. The variable, or treatment, would be the amount of hours played. Some subjects would play for either 20 mins, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours. Before and after they would fill out the following information:

The [Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AfGPnQOtVGi7Xo4GMzpBaZ78jYp-7PPU/view), or IGDS9-SF is a form used to evaluate whether or not someone suffers from Internert Gaming Disorder, of IGD. One answers 9 questions, which the following options: Never (1 point), Rarely (2 points), Sometimes (3 points), Often (4 points), Very Often (5 points). Your overal score can range from a 9-45; as your score increases, with higher scores being indicative of a higher degree of Internet Gaming Disorder.

The [Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21](https://maic.qld.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DASS-21.pdf), or DASS-21 is a form used to evaluate whether or not someone suffers from Depression, Anxeity, or Stress. After answering a series of questions from a scale of 0-3, the final score shows the following:

|       | Description | Anxiety | Stress |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------| -----------|
| Normal      | 0-9       | 0-7       | 0-14       |
| Mild   | 10-13        | 8-9       | 15-18      |
| Moderate   | 14-20        | 10-14       | 19-25       |
| Severe   | 21-27        | 15-19       | 26-33       |
| Extremely Severe   | 28+        | 20+       | 34+      |

The [Insomnia Severity Index](https://www.ons.org/sites/default/files/InsomniaSeverityIndex_ISI.pdf), or ISI is a form used to evaluate the severity or existence of one's insomnia. After answering a questionarie, your final score shows the following:

|       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 0–7       | No clinically significant insomnia        |
| 8–14   | Subthreshold insomnia        |
| 15–21    | Clinical insomnia (moderate severity)        |
| 22–28   | Clinical insomnia (severe)        |

Finally, we would use our own survery, from a scale of 1 to 10, to describe how each subjects are to interact with friends and family: a 1 means they are eager to socialize, a 10 means they would hate to socialize.

Then, we would compare the subjects' results before and after the experiement. If on average the subjets' scores are higher after the experiement, we know that there is a connection between extensive gaming and the brain, especially how does it effect social interaction and mental health.



#### 9. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
A bias I would worry about is the accuracy of the study. For example, if my sample frame is mainly white men, it would not represent most games. Also, if subjects already have high IGDS9-SF, DASS-21, and ISI scores, our data can be skewed. These problems can be solved by asking for a diverse range of students from each college, and making sure the subjects start off in an environment where they are mentally stable and healthy.
