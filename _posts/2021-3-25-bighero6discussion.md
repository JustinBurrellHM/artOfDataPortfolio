# Discussion: Big Hero 6!

#### 1. What is Baymax’s original purpose? Would you consider him AGI?
Baymax is an inflatable robot that scans patients, detects their vital stats, and can treat the patient. I would consider Baymax AGI because Baymax can understand and evaluate medical patients. No, Baymax cannot understand everything, but after Hiro weaponizes him, Baymax learns to excel in combat.

#### 2. What rights are violated when Baymax scans the entire city? Does tracking a “villain” justify these violations?
Baymax scanned the entire city without the consent of the city government. Even though they were tracking a "villain," their actions were not justified. It is hard to talk about the solution to this problem because they would not have caught the villain without using this tech; however, it sets the precedent of developers using their AGI whenever they want regardless of the laws they break. There has to be a middle ground. Maybe Baymax and Hiro could have worked with the police and got permission to use the tech. Even then, does the government have the right to invade our privacy? We need to set regulations for tech, so these mishaps don't happen.

#### 3. Should personal development of technology be regulated, and if so, by who?
The personal development of technology should be regulated by a council associated with the federal government. For example, according to [hse.gov](https://www.hse.gov.uk/healthservices/arrangements.htm), "The HCPC regulates 15 healthcare professionals: arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists, clinical scientists, dieticians, hearing aid dispensers, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, practitioner psychologists, prosthetists / orthotists, radiographers, and speech and language therapists. From 1st August 2012, the HCPC also assumed responsibility for regulating social workers in England." There should be an organization similar to the HCPC for AGI. This organization would foster a community of developers that ethically create AGI that advances society

#### 4. Who is responsible for the collateral damage caused by AI/technology? Does this change if it’s AGI?
In a scenario that an HCPC-like environment is in place, this organization would hold developers accountable. If someone creates a self-learning machine, they are responsible for making sure things do not get out of hand. Humans have intuition and emotion, and therefore, we are responsible for how advanced AGI becomes and how much collateral damage they commit. We are not in the world of Terminator or any other sci-fi movie where AGI rules the world. Humans are in control. And we must pay the price for our mistakes.

#### 5. Should AI / technology still be used even if there is a high risk of great collateral damage?
Tech is excellent; it allows society to do things that were once unthinkable. However, as we continue to advance our tech, we need to hold ourselves accountable. We need to have associations and regulations in place so people cannot do whatever they want. AGI is a high-risk industry; however, with strict rules, we can create an environment where developers can safely create AGI without harming others.
