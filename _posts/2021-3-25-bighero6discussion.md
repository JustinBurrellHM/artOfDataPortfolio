# Discussion: Big Hero 6!

#### 1. What is Baymax’s original purpose? Would you consider him AGI?


#### 2. What rights are violated when Baymax scans the entire city? Does tracking a “villain” justify these violations?


#### 3. Should personal development of technology be regulated, and if so, by who?


#### 4. Who is responsible for the collateral damage caused by AI/technology? Does this change if it’s AGI?


#### 5. Should AI / technology still be used even if there is a high risk of great collateral damage?
